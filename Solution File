-- 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
-- 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
-- 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
-- 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
-- 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
-- 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
-- 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
-- 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
-- 9.  If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
-- 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

 --QUESTION 1:
  --What is the Total Amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
    
    Answer: A	76
            B	74
            C	36

--Use Innerjoin between Sales and Menu table:
    
    SELECT customer_iD, price
    FROM dbo.sales
    INNER JOIN dbo.menu 
    ON dbo.sales.product_id = dbo.menu.product_id

--Complete the the query using SUM and Group BY:
    
    SELECT customer_id, SUM (price) AS Amount_spent
    FROM dbo.sales
    INNER JOIN dbo.menu 
    ON dbo.sales.product_id = dbo.menu.product_id 
    GROUP BY customer_id
    
  
  
  --QUESTION 2:
  --How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
    
    Answer: A	6
            B	6
            C	3


--use COUNT and GROUP BY:

    	SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_date) AS no_of_visits
    	FROM sales
    	GROUP BY customer_id

  
  
  --QUESTION 3:
  --What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
      
      Answer: 2021-01-01	A	sushi
              2021-01-01	A	curry
              2021-01-01	B	curry

  -- Use Joins to join the tables sales and menu:

      FROM dbo.sales
      INNER JOIN dbo.menu
      ON dbo.sales.product_id = dbo.menu.product_id
      ORDER BY order_date asc;

  --After finding out the first date, use WHERE clause to make the results clear:

  --QUESTION 4:
  --What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
      
      Answer: ramen	8
              curry	4
